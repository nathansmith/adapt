      What is this?
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/nathansmith/adapt/blob/master/assets/js/adapt.js">Adapt.js</a> is a lightweight (755 bytes <a href="https://github.com/nathansmith/adapt/blob/master/assets/js/adapt.min.js">minified</a>) JavaScript file that determines which CSS file to load before the browser renders a page. If the browser tilts or resizes, Adapt.js simply checks its width, and serves only the CSS that is needed, when it is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A potential drawback of Adapt.js is the possibility of a brief flash of unstyled content as a new stylesheet is being fetched (think of it as “Ajax” for CSS). I have done my best to mitigate this by keeping CSS files small (3 KB). It is worth noting this is a proposed, not prescribed, approach to a problem with multiple solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other methods include: Build a <a href="http://mobify.me/">separate</a> site for <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/">mobile</a>. Or, use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">media queries</a> to adjust layout, with a <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond">polyfill</a> for older browser support, and conditional Internet Explorer <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/4494/">comments</a> for Windows phones. Also a factor is how to handle multiple image resolutions without adding file size. Filament Group is advocating <a href="http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_images_experimenting_with_context_aware_image_sizing/">context aware</a> image sizing.

      Configuration
    </h3>
    <p>
      To use Adapt.js, all you have to do is set up a few parameters: <code>path</code> is the directory structure in which your stylesheets reside, <code>dynamic</code> is a boolean (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) that tells Adapt.js whether to watch the <code>window</code> for its <code>resize</code> event, also triggered by tablet or phone tilt. Lastly, <code>range</code> defines the screen widths to associate with various CSS files. The defaults are shown in the adjacent code example.

      Fallback
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the case of JavaScript being purposefully disabled or unavailable, stylesheet defaults can be served via <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code>, which is perfectly valid in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-noscript-element">HTML5</a>. Taking a <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933">mobile first</a> approach, I specified the mobile.css file, assuming devices without JS capabilities are likely to be less capable “feature” phones.

      “It Depends”
    </h4>
    <p>
      As with any field in which technological methods are open for debate, there is the danger of religious fanaticism, where we each rally behind a respective technique and defend it vehemently. I would advise you to consider your audience, weigh the options, and find an approach that makes sense for that particular context.

      This whole browser resizing craze was started by none other than the inestimable <a href="http://ethanmarcotte.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a>, when he wrote his seminal article for A List Apart, entitled <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a>. Since then, some have <a href="http://tripleodeon.com/2010/10/not-a-mobile-web-merely-a-320px-wide-one/">criticized</a> <code>@media</code> queries as <a href="http://www.cloudfour.com/css-media-query-for-mobile-is-fools-gold/">fool’s gold</a>. Also worth reading are <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1716/">One Web</a> and <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/toffee-nosed/">Toffee-Nosed</a>, further defining responsiveness.
