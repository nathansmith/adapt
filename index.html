      What is this?
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/nathansmith/adapt/blob/master/assets/js/adapt.js">Adapt.js</a> is a lightweight (940 bytes <a href="assets/js/adapt.min.js">minified</a>) JavaScript file that determines which CSS file to load before the browser renders a page. It is worth noting this is a proposed, not prescribed, approach to a problem with multiple solutions. Other methods include: building a <a href="http://mobify.me/">separate site</a> for mobile, or using a media queries to adjust layouts dynamically, with a <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond">polyfill</a> for older browser support. Also a factor is how to handle <a href="http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_images_experimenting_with_context_aware_image_sizing/">image</a> resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adapt.js simply checks the browser width, and serves only the CSS that is needed, when it is needed. A potential drawback of Adapt.js is the possibility of a brief flash of unstyled content as a new stylesheet is being fetched (think of it as “Ajax” for CSS). However, I have done my best to mitigate this by keeping CSS files small (3 KB). Once a CSS file is fetched for the first time, it is cached thereafter, not causing any further HTTP requests.

      Configuration
    </h3>
    <p>
      To use Adapt.js, all you have to do is set up a few parameters: <code>path</code> is the directory structure in which your stylesheets reside, <code>dynamic</code> is a boolean (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) that tells Adapt.js whether to watch for the <code>window</code> to fire <code>resize</code> and <code>orientationchange</code> events. Lastly, <code>range</code> defines the screen widths to associate with various CSS files. The defaults are shown in the adjacent code example.

      Fallback
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the case of JavaScript being purposefully disabled or unavailable, stylesheet defaults can be served via <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code>, which is perfectly valid in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-noscript-element">HTML5</a>. Taking a <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933">mobile first</a> approach, I specified the mobile.css file, assuming devices without JS capabilities are likely to be less capable “feature” phones.

      This whole browser resizing craze was started by none other than the inestimable <a href="http://ethanmarcotte.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a>, when he wrote his seminal article for A List Apart, entitled <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a>. Since then, some have <a href="http://tripleodeon.com/2010/10/not-a-mobile-web-merely-a-320px-wide-one/">criticized</a> <code>@media</code> queries as <a href="http://www.cloudfour.com/css-media-query-for-mobile-is-fools-gold/">fool's gold</a>, well intentioned but not fully suited to handle the task of a truly <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1716/">One Web</a> approach.

      “It Depends”
    </h4>
    <p>
      As with any area in which technological approaches are open for debate, there is the danger of religious fanaticism, where we each rally behind a respective method and defend it vehemently. I would caution you to weigh the options, consider mobile users, and choose an approach makes sense for you.
